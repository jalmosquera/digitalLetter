### 3. **Agents Updated with Linear Integration**

All agents now follow this workflow:

**BEFORE starting work:**

2. Update issue state to "In Progress"

**AFTER completing work:**
1. Update issue state to "Done"
2. Add comment to Linear issue with summary
3. Commit with new format (emoji + bullets + Linear issue reference)

## 🔄 Linear Workflow Summary

### For All Agents (except REVIEW):

**Step 1: Start**
```
Search Linear issue → Move to "In Progress"
```

**Step 2: Work**
```
Create branch → Implement changes
```

**Step 3: Finish**
```
Commit (emoji + bullets + Linear ref) → Move to "Done" → Add comment
```

### For REVIEW Agent:

**Different approach:**
```
Analyze code → Suggest Linear issues to create → Recommend which agent to call
```

REVIEW does NOT:
- Create Linear issues automatically
- Make commits
- Implement changes

REVIEW DOES:
- Suggest which issues to create in Linear
- Provide format: [TYPE] [PRIORITY] Description
- Recommend which agent should fix each issue

## 📝 Example Workflow

### Scenario: User wants to add Product model

1. **Linear Issue Created Manually:**
   - Title: "Create Product model with CRUD"
   - Status: Todo
   - ID: JALTEAM-60

2. **User calls BUILD:**
   ```
   "BUILD, create Product model with name, price, stock"
   ```

3. **BUILD Agent:**
   - Searches Linear for "Product model"
   - Finds JALTEAM-60
   - Updates status to "In Progress"
   - Creates branch: `feature/product-model`
   - Implements Product model
   - Commits with format:
     ```bash
     feat: ✨ add Product model with inventory management
     - Create Product model with name, price, stock fields
     - Add price validation (must be positive)
     - Add stock validation (must be >= 0)
     - Implement is_available() method
     - Configure admin interface
     - Linear issue: JALTEAM-60

     ```
   - Updates JALTEAM-60 to "Done"
   - Adds comment: "Product model implemented with validations and admin config"
   - Pushes branch

4. **User calls REVIEW (optional):**
   ```
   "REVIEW, analyze Product model"
   ```

5. **REVIEW Agent:**
   - Analyzes code
   - Finds issue: missing tests
   - Suggests:
     ```
     📋 SUGERENCIAS PARA LINEAR:
     - [TEST] [HIGH] Add unit tests for Product model
     - [TEST] [MEDIUM] Add integration tests for Product API
     ```
   - Does NOT create issues, just suggests

6. **User creates suggested issues manually in Linear**

7. **User calls TEST:**
   ```
   "TEST, create tests for Product model"
   ```

8. **TEST Agent:**
   - Searches Linear for "Product model tests"
   - Finds JALTEAM-61
   - Updates to "In Progress"
   - Creates branch: `test/product-model`
   - Writes tests (60-80% coverage)
   - Commits:
     ```bash
     test: 🧪 add comprehensive Product model tests
     - Add test_product_creation with valid data
     - Add test_price_validation for negative prices
     - Add test_stock_validation for negative stock
     - Add test_is_available logic
     - Coverage achieved: 75%
     - Linear issue: JALTEAM-61

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Agents DO:
- ✅ Search for existing Linear issues
- ✅ Update issue states (Todo → In Progress → Done)
- ✅ Add comments to issues with summaries
- ✅ Reference Linear issues in commits

### What Agents DON'T DO:
- ❌ Create new Linear issues automatically
- ❌ Auto-assign issues
- ❌ Modify issue descriptions or priorities

### Why?
- You maintain control over what gets tracked
- You decide priorities and assignments
- Agents just update progress on existing work

---

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

All agents are now Linear-aware and will:
1. Search for related issues when they start
2. Update states as they work
3. Commit with proper format (emoji + bullets + Linear ref)
4. Mark work as done with summary comments

The system is ready to use! 🚀
